Scripts that Install 3D Printer Software on a Raspberry Pi

One of my interests is additive manufacturing. The scripts in this repository generate Linux software that is useful for 3D printing applications.

Prusa Slicer is an open source program that translates Solid Model engineering drawings into the g-code that drives various models of 3D printers. It is useable by most RepRap style printers.
