Scripts that Install 3D Printer Software on a Raspberry Pi

One of my interests is additive manufacturing. The scripts in this repository generate Linux software that is useful for 3D printing applications. Prusa Slicer is an open source program that translates Solid Model engineering drawings into the g-code that drives various models of 3D printers. It can be configured to work with by most RepRap style printers.Currently the PrusaSlicer version 2.6.0 software is the stable release. 

In the Home directory create another directory named src. Place a copy of the script you want to compile in that directory.  Change the Permissions properties of the script to Execute:Anyone. In a terminal change the current direcory to the src directory that was just created.  Execute the script by typing "./(full-Name-of-the-script).sh" without the quotes.  

The compile time for the script on a RaspberryPi 4 is approximately five hours.
